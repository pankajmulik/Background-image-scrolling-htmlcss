        <p>How to extract or copy text from a picture
            Before I show you the way, I’ll like you to know that there is no image to text converter that can handle blurry and dark pictures. So, if you want a clean extract, ensure that your images are not blurry or dark. Also, make sure that the pictures are not flipped upside down. This way, you’ll be able to extract accurate text from your image.
            
            I am sure you already have your image ready.
